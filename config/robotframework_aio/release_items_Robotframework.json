**New log level** ``USER``

This release introduces a new log level ``USER``. In the hierarchy of log levels, the level ``USER`` is located between ``INFO`` and ``WARNING``.
It can be used to have a better separation between user specific log output and standard ``INFO`` messages from Robot Framework itself.

The default log level ist still ``INFO``. Therefore the log level ``USER`` has to be set explicitely. This can be done in the following ways:

* *In robot code*:

   .. code::

      log    my log message    USER

* *In command line of test execution*: 

   .. code::

      python.exe -m robot --loglevel USER testfile.robot
