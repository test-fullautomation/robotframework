# ========== Release Items for component 'Robotframework' ==========
#
# Basically this component is stand-alone, but can also be used as part of an automation framework called
# RobotFramework AIO. More information about this framework you can find here:
# 
# https://github.com/test-fullautomation/RobotFramework_AIO
# 
# This JSON file contains component specific release information for the RobotFramework AIO.
# In case you use the component stand-alone only, you can ignore this file.

**New log level** ``USER``

This release introduces a new log level ``USER``. In the hierarchy of log levels, the level ``USER`` is located between ``INFO`` and ``WARNING``.
It can be used to have a better separation between user specific log output and standard ``INFO`` messages from Robot Framework itself.

The default log level ist still ``INFO``. Therefore the log level ``USER`` has to be set explicitely. This can be done in the following ways:

* *In robot code*:

   .. code::

      log    my log message    USER

* *In command line of test execution*: 

   .. code::

      python.exe -m robot --loglevel USER testfile.robot

**Stabilize Threading Feature:**

We have enhanced the stability of our threading feature, ensuring smoother performance and reliability in multi-threaded environments.

**Bug Fix in Threading Feature:**

This release includes a fixes for a previously identified bugs in our threading feature. This fix enhances the functionality and reliability of thread-based operations.

**Send Thread Notification:**

A new keyword, Wait Thread Notification, has been added to allow threads to wait for specific notifications. This is vital for synchronized operations and responsive multi-threaded interactions.

* *In robot code*:

   .. code::

      Send Thread Notification     notification_name     params=data     dst_thread=thread_name
